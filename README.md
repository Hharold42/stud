Design the grid: Minesweeper is played on a grid of cells. Decide on the size of the grid, the number of mines, and the dimensions of each cell.

Create the grid: In your chosen programming language, create a data structure to represent the grid. This can be a 2D array or a collection of objects.

Place mines: Randomly distribute the mines across the grid. Make sure you don't place more mines than the specified number.

Calculate mine counts: For each cell that doesn't contain a mine, calculate the number of neighboring cells that do contain mines. This number represents the clue for that cell.

Display the grid: Show the initial state of the grid to the player. Each cell can be represented by a character or an image, depending on your user interface.

Handle user input: Implement the logic to handle user input. Allow the player to select a cell or flag it as a potential mine. When the player selects a cell, reveal its content (mine or clue) and update the display.

Handle game rules: Implement the rules of Minesweeper. If the player selects a mine, the game ends. If the player selects a clue, reveal the neighboring cells recursively until a cell with adjacent mines is reached.

Game loop: Set up a loop that continues until the game ends. Inside the loop, continually prompt the player for input and update the grid accordingly.

End game: When the game ends, reveal the entire grid to the player. Optionally, display a message indicating whether the player won or lost.

Optional features: You can enhance your Minesweeper implementation by adding additional features, such as a timer, a scoring system, different difficulty levels, or a graphical user interface.


Beginner level: For a small grid, such as 9x9 or 8x8, you can start with around 10% to 15% of the total cells being mines. So, for a 9x9 grid, you could have 10 to 15 mines.

Intermediate level: For a medium-sized grid, like 16x16 or 12x12, you can increase the number of mines to around 20% to 25% of the total cells. For example, a 16x16 grid can have approximately 40 to 64 mines.

Expert level: For larger grids, such as 30x16 or 20x20, you can have a higher percentage of mines, ranging from 25% to 35%. So, for a 30x16 grid, you could have around 120 to 168 mines.
